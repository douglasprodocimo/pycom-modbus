# pycom-modbus
This is a fork from [Sfera-labs](https://github.com/sfera-labs) [pycom-modbus](https://github.com/sfera-labs/pycom-modbus) lib, works in micropython, this fork is adapted
to work on ESP32 module from [Espressif](http://www.spressif.com).
Until now I've just needed the RTU module, and minor changes are made t=in the original lib to get work.
